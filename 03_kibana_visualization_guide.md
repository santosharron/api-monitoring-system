# API Monitoring Visualization Guide with Kibana

## Accessing Kibana

1. Navigate to Elastic Cloud dashboard at https://cloud.elastic.co
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Select your deployment (ai-agent-monitoring)
4. Click on "Kibana" to open the Kibana interface

## Essential Visualizations

### 1. API Response Time Dashboard

Create a dashboard with:

- **Line Chart**: Average response time by API endpoint with anomaly detection bands
- **Heat Map**: Response time distribution by hour/day
- **Time Series**: 95th percentile response times across environments
- **Anomaly Explorer**: Highlight unusual response time patterns

Steps:
1. In Kibana, go to Dashboard → Create dashboard
2. Add visualizations using + button
3. For each visualization, select data source and appropriate metrics
4. Save dashboard as "API Response Time Overview"

### 2. Error Rate Monitoring

Create visualizations for:

- **Gauge**: Current error rate percentage with thresholds
- **Bar Chart**: Error count by API endpoint
- **Line Chart**: Error trend over time with anomaly markers
- **Data Table**: Top error types with counts

Steps:
1. Use Lens or TSVB visualization tools
2. Configure alerts for error rates exceeding thresholds
3. Add environmental context to error visualizations

### 3. Cross-Environment Performance

Create a dashboard showing:

- **Coordinate Map**: API performance by geographic region
- **Vertical Bar Chart**: Comparison of same API across different environments
- **Area Chart**: Traffic volume across environments
- **Status Grid**: Health indicators for each environment

### 4. Predictive Analytics View

Create visualizations for:

- **Forecasting Chart**: Predicted API load and response times
- **ML Job Status**: View of anomaly detection job status
- **Anomaly Timeline**: Chronological view of detected anomalies
- **Impact Analysis**: Relationship mapping between failing APIs

## Setting Up Alerts

1. Go to Stack Management → Rules and Connectors
2. Create rules for:
   - Response time exceeding thresholds
   - Error rate anomalies
   - Predictive failure warnings
   - Cross-environment correlation issues

## Presenting to Stakeholders

When demonstrating this system:

1. Start with the high-level dashboard overview
2. Show how anomaly detection works with real examples
3. Demonstrate the cross-environment correlation capabilities
4. Highlight the predictive capabilities and how they prevent outages
5. Show the alerting system and response workflow

## Best Practices

- Use consistent color coding across dashboards
- Create role-based dashboards for different teams
- Set appropriate time ranges for different visualizations
- Include documentation within dashboards using markdown visualizations
- Save and share URLs with specific filters applied for common scenarios

## Maintenance

- Review dashboard usefulness quarterly
- Update anomaly thresholds as system behavior evolves
- Archive historical dashboards for comparison
