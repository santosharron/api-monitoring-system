# API Monitoring System Presentation Guide

## Starting the Application

1. Ensure the environment variables are properly configured in the `.env` file
2. Start the application using:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
3. Verify the application is running by checking logs:
   ```
   Monitoring system started successfully
   Collectors initialized across all environments
   Connected to Elasticsearch cloud instance
   ```

## Explaining the System Architecture

When presenting the solution, explain these key components:

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Collects API logs across multiple environments (on-premises, AWS, Azure, GCP)
   - Uses OpenTelemetry for standardized logging
   - Processes and normalizes data from different sources

2. **Processing & Analysis Layer**
   - MongoDB for storing processed metrics and baseline data
   - Elasticsearch for real-time analysis and time-series data
   - ML models for anomaly detection and prediction

3. **Visualization Layer (Kibana)**
   - Real-time dashboards showing system health
   - Anomaly detection visualizations
   - Cross-environment correlation views

## Demo Flow

1. **Overview (5 minutes)**
   - Explain the problem: monitoring distributed APIs across environments
   - Show system architecture diagram
   - Highlight AI-powered features

2. **Live Dashboard Demo (10 minutes)**
   - Navigate to Kibana dashboards
   - Show API response time monitoring
   - Demonstrate error rate analysis
   - Explain cross-environment correlation views

3. **Anomaly Detection Showcase (7 minutes)**
   - Show historical anomalies that were detected
   - Explain how the system uses ML to establish baselines
   - Demonstrate how alerts are triggered

4. **Predictive Analytics (5 minutes)**
   - Show forecasting capabilities
   - Explain how the system predicts potential failures
   - Demonstrate impact analysis visualizations

5. **Q&A (10 minutes)**

## Key Talking Points

- **Distributed Architecture Awareness**: Emphasize how the system understands constraints of different environments
- **End-to-End Request Journeys**: Highlight tracking of requests across multiple services and environments
- **Adaptive Baseline**: Explain how the system learns normal behavior patterns for each API
- **Predictive Capabilities**: Discuss how ML models forecast issues before they impact users
- **Scalability**: Note how the system handles high volumes of API calls without performance degradation

## Technical Questions to Prepare For

1. How does the system correlate events across different environments?
2. What ML techniques are used for anomaly detection?
3. How are alerts prioritized to prevent alert fatigue?
4. How does the system differentiate between temporary spikes and actual anomalies?
5. What's the storage footprint and retention policy?
