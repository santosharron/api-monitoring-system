# AI-Powered API Monitoring and Anomaly Detection System

An intelligent monitoring solution for large-scale, distributed multi-API platforms that can detect anomalies, predict potential issues, and provide actionable insights across on-premises, cloud, and multi-cloud environments.

## Features

- **Cross-Environment Monitoring**: Monitor APIs across on-premises, cloud, and multi-cloud infrastructures
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify response time and error rate anomalies using AI algorithms
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast potential issues before they impact users
- **End-to-End Request Tracking**: Follow request journeys across distributed environments
- **Adaptive Alerting**: Smart alerts that reduce noise and provide actionable insights
- **Visualization Dashboards**: Real-time and historical performance visualization

## Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

- **Collectors**: Gather logs and metrics from various API sources
- **Storage**: Centralized storage for logs, metrics, and analysis results
- **Analyzers**: AI-powered components for anomaly detection and prediction
- **Alerting**: Intelligent alerting system with customizable rules
- **API**: RESTful API for system configuration and data access
- **Visualization**: Dashboards for monitoring and insights

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
