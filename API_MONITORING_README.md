# AI-Powered API Monitoring System

This system provides real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics for distributed APIs across multiple environments (on-premises, cloud, multi-cloud).

## Overview

The API Monitoring System:
- Monitors API response times and error rates across different environments
- Detects anomalies using Elasticsearch Machine Learning
- Generates alerts when issues are detected
- Visualizes performance metrics and anomalies in Kibana dashboards
- Provides predictive insights to identify potential issues before they impact users

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up environment variables (or use the defaults in the script):
   ```
   export ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID="your_cloud_id"
   export ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME="elastic"
   export ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD="your_password"
   export KIBANA_BASE_URL="your_kibana_url"
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```
   python api_monitoring_setup.py
   ```

4. Access the dashboards and ML views via the URLs provided in the script output.

## System Components

### 1. Data Collection and Storage

- **Index Templates**: Pre-configured mappings for API metrics and anomalies
- **Sample Data Generation**: Creates realistic API metrics with patterns and anomalies
- **Data Storage**: Elasticsearch indices optimized for time-series analysis

### 2. Anomaly Detection

Three ML jobs are created:
- **Response Time Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual response times
- **Error Rate Analysis**: Detects spikes in API errors
- **Cross-Environment Correlation**: Analyzes patterns across different environments

### 3. Alerting System

Configures alerts for:
- High response times (above thresholds)
- Error rate spikes
- Anomaly scores exceeding defined thresholds

### 4. Visualizations

Creates Kibana dashboards:
- **API Overview Dashboard**: General health metrics of all APIs
- **Anomaly Detection Dashboard**: Visualization of detected anomalies
- **Cross-Environment Analysis**: Correlations across environments

## Using the Dashboards

### API Overview Dashboard

This dashboard provides a high-level view of API performance:
- Response time metrics by API and environment
- Error rates by API and environment
- Health status indicators

### Anomaly Detection Dashboard

This dashboard shows detected anomalies:
- Timeline of anomalies
- Anomaly severity distribution
- Detailed anomaly information

### ML Explorer

Access the ML Explorer to:
- View detected anomalies in detail
- Analyze the anomaly score timeline
- Investigate specific time periods

## Alert Configuration

The system creates alert configurations that you can import into Kibana:
1. Go to Kibana → Stack Management → Rules and Connectors
2. Click "Import" and select the JSON files from the `alerts` directory
3. Configure notification channels (email, Slack, etc.)

## Customization

### Adjusting ML Jobs

To modify ML job parameters:
1. Edit the job configuration files in the `jobs` directory
2. Delete existing jobs in Kibana (ML → Job Management)
3. Run the setup script again to create updated jobs

### Creating Custom Visualizations

1. Use the Kibana UI to create custom visualizations
2. Add them to existing dashboards or create new dashboards
3. Export the dashboard JSON for backup or sharing

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you encounter connection issues:
- Verify your Elasticsearch credentials
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure your account has the required permissions

### Missing Data

If dashboards show no data:
- Verify the sample data was generated successfully
- Check that indices were created properly
- Validate index patterns in Kibana

### ML Job Failures

If ML jobs fail to run:
- Ensure your Elasticsearch deployment has ML enabled
- Check for sufficient memory allocation
- Verify the indices contain appropriate data

## Next Steps

To extend the system:
1. Integrate with real API logs using Filebeat or Logstash
2. Set up cross-cluster monitoring for multi-cloud environments
3. Implement advanced forecasting for predictive maintenance
4. Create custom ML models for specific API patterns
